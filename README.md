# Simple Unit Converter App
Simple Unit Converter App written using python and Flask as the backend and a little bit of JS for the front-end.

## Features
* Temperature conversion
* Weight conversion
* Length conversion
  
The app can do simple unit conversion for the selected unit.

## Bugs i want to fix

Currently the most prominent bug is when the page refreshesh or the user submits the drop down menu for the unit conversion doesn't update to show only the relavant units for the category.

## TODO features

With time i would like to add more unit and also touch some CSS to style the webpage because it's an abomination right now :)
